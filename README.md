## Vision
The goal is to create an immersive and interactive text-based game with modular design and extendable features. The project will evolve from a single-player core gameplay experience into an advanced system with persistent worlds and optional multiplayer support.

## Phase 1: Core Game Functionality
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Goal:** Establish the foundational architecture and implement essential game mechanics.

- Design and implement the **StateManager** for managing game states.
- Create foundational states:
  - `MainMenuState`: Navigate between options.
  - `CharacterCreationState`: Create and save new characters.
  - `ExitState`: Handle game termination.
- Build the **Game** loop for seamless transitions and input handling.
- Implement the **Character** and **Stats** classes for encapsulating character data.
- Develop the **CharacterManager** for:
  - Creating characters.
  - Saving/loading characters from JSON.
  - Listing available characters.
- Ensure functionality through:
  - Unit tests for all components.
  - Integration tests for core interactions.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks  
**Goal:** Add gameplay depth through combat, leveling, and inventory systems.

- Introduce character progression with:
  - A leveling system.
  - Experience points and stat upgrades.
- Implement an **Inventory** system:
  - Manage items with attributes like type and effects.
  - Add an `ItemManager` for item-related operations.
- Build a basic turn-based **Combat System**:
  - Create a `CombatState` for player-enemy interactions.
  - Include options for attacking, defending, and item use.
  - Implement basic enemy AI.
- Improve user interface:
  - Enhance menu navigation.
  - Format output for better readability.
- Expand test coverage for new features:
  - Combat and inventory unit tests.
  - End-to-end tests for combat scenarios.

---

## Phase 3: Persistent World and Advanced Features
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
**Goal:** Develop a persistent world with exploration mechanics and advanced combat.

- Introduce a **WorldManager** for managing a persistent game world:
  - Save and load game progress.
  - Procedural or predefined dungeon generation.
- Add an **ExplorationState**:
  - Dungeon crawling with enemy encounters.
  - Interactions with objects or loot.
- Enhance combat:
  - Introduce skills, magic, or special moves.
  - Create advanced enemy behaviors (e.g., boss mechanics).
- Refactor the codebase for performance and maintainability.
- Improve immersion with:
  - Colorful output or visual enhancements.
  - Sound or simple animations (optional).
- Ensure robustness with:
  - Comprehensive unit and integration testing.

---

## Phase 4: Multiplayer and Community Features (Optional)
**Timeline:** 6+ weeks  
**Goal:** Expand to multiplayer and community-driven content for long-term engagement.

- Design **multiplayer gameplay**:
  - Add support for local or online multiplayer.
  - Create cooperative or competitive modes.
- Enable **community content**:
  - Allow modding or custom character creation.
  - Share custom dungeons or challenges.
- Perform stress testing and ensure scalability for deployment.
- Deploy a polished, feature-complete game.
